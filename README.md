# My Digital Business Card Project

This is a simple, clean, and responsive **digital business card** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Flexbox**. The goal of this project is to visually present personal or professional details in a modern, card-style layout — perfect for a portfolio, personal site, or small business.

## Features

* Responsive layout using **CSS Flexbox**
* Clean and minimal design
* Profile picture and name display
* Role/title and short bio or description
* Easy to customize for personal use

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5** – structure and content
* **CSS3** – styling and layout
* **Flexbox** – for modern and responsive alignment
* (Optional) **Google Fonts** – for better typography
* (Optional) Placeholder image or real profile picture

*Note: JavaScript is not included in the initial version of this project, but it may be added in the future to support interactivity and dynamic features.*

## File Structure

```
project-folder/
│
├── index.html         # Main HTML file
├── styles.css         # CSS file for styling the card
├── /Images/           # Folder to store profile picture or assets
│   └── profile.jpg
└── README.md          # This file
```

## How It Works

1. The HTML file contains a container `<div>` with a class like `card-box`, holding the image and text elements.
2. Flexbox is used in the CSS to place the image and content side by side in a clean column layout.
3. The card is designed to be scalable and easy to adapt for other users or business roles.
4. All content (name, role, image) can be changed in the HTML for reuse.

## Customization Tips

* Replace the profile picture with your own in the `/Images/` folder.
* Edit the `<h1>` and `<p>` tags to add your name and job title.
* Modify the CSS file to change background colors, fonts, spacing, or layout.

## Example Output

(Optional: add a screenshot or mockup here)

## Future Ideas

* Add social media icons with links
* Include an interactive “Download vCard” button
* Add contact info like email or phone
* Animate the card on hover or load
* Introduce JavaScript for interactivity (e.g., theme toggling, animations, live contact forms)
